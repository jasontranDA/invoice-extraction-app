We‚Äôll walk through the **RAG pipeline** step by step to process and extract key invoice details such as invoice date, client name, total amount.\n",

    "- **Local language model (Llama3.2 via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)):** Using local models is more secure for private data, such as the invoices in this case.\n",

    "Congratulations on successfully implementing your first RAG-powered invoice extraction system! üéâ\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to extract structured data from invoices.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Used LangChain to process documents efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Integrated a local LLM with Ollama for offline, cost-effective processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Developed a Streamlit web application for an interactive, user-friendly experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí°If you're excited to adapt this project to other use cases, here are some inspiration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automated Resume Screening ‚Äì Extract key details from resumes and match them with job descriptions.\n",
    "2. Contract Clause Extraction ‚Äì Identify and summarize important clauses from legal contracts.\n",
    "3. Expense Receipt Processing ‚Äì Automate the extraction of transaction details from receipts for expense tracking.\n",
    "4. Medical Report Summarization ‚Äì Convert lengthy medical reports into structured, digestible summaries.\n",
    "5. Customer Support Ticket Analysis ‚Äì Categorize and extract key insights from support requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚öôÔ∏è Deploy this project**\n",
